#
# This module provides a way of automatically generating command objects for madeleine to
# store.  It works by making a proxy object for all objects of any classes in which it is included.
# Method calls to these objects are intercepted, and stored as a command before being
# passed on to the real receiver.  The command objects remember which object the command was
# destined for by using a pair of internal ids that are contained in each of the proxy objects.
#
# There is also a mechanism for specifying which methods not to intercept calls to by using
# automatic_read_only, and its opposite automatic_read_write.
#
# Should you require it, the snapshots can be stored as yaml, and can be compressed.  Just pass 
# the marshaller you want to use as the second argument to AutomaticSnapshotMadeleine.new.  
# If the passed marshaller did not successfully deserialize the latest snapshot, the system 
# will try to automatically detect and read either Marshal, YAML, SOAP, or their corresponding
# compressed versions.
#
# This module is designed to work correctly in the case there are multiple madeleine systems in use by
# a single program, and is also safe to use with threads.
#
# Usage:
#
#  require 'madeleine'
#  require 'madeleine/automatic'
#
#  class A
#    include Madeleine::Automatic::Interceptor
#    attr_reader :foo
#    automatic_read_only :foo
#    def initialize(param1, ...)
#      ...
#    end
#    def some_method(paramA, ...)
#      ...
#    end
#    automatic_read_only
#    def bigfoo
#      foo.upcase
#    end
#  end
#
#  mad = AutomaticSnapshotMadeleine.new("storage_directory") { A.new(param1, ...) }
#
#  mad.system.some_method(paramA, ...) # logged as a command by madeleine
#  print mad.system.foo                # not logged
#  print mad.system.bigfoo             # not logged
#  mad.take_snapshot

  module Automatic
#
# This module should be included (at the top) in any classes that are to be persisted.
# It will intercept method calls and make sure they are converted into commands that are logged by Madeleine.
# It does this by returning a Prox object that is a proxy for the real object.
#
# It also handles automatic_read_only and automatic_read_write, allowing user specification of which methods
# should be made into commands
#

# The second initialisation parameter is the persister.  Supported persisters are:
#
# * Marshal  (default)
# * YAML
# * SOAP::Marshal
# * Madeleine::ZMarshal.new(Marshal)
# * Madeleine::ZMarshal.new(YAML)
# * Madeleine::ZMarshal.new(SOAP::Marshal)
#
# The class keeps a record of all the systems that currently exist.
# Each instance of the class keeps a record of Prox objects in that system by internal id (myid).
